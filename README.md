# hungry5656's dotfiles

Here are all the default dotfiles I use for a new dev environment.

I am still trying to write a script to automate the process of installing these dotfiles

```tree
.gitignore
.gitconfig
...
```

### Usage
```console
foo@hungry5656:~$ sh conda-env-install.sh <pkg_list> <env_name>
```
